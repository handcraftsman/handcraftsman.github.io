The case involved a dispute over the estate of "Matthew Grove". Bob Allen obtained a copy of the original records in the Augusta County, Virginia Courthouse that Chalkley viewed in writing his abstract of this lawsuit. The actual record reveals that the family involved in the lawsuit is "Glave", not "Grove". Although the document is quite lengthy and overly verbose, the key points are listed below.<BR />Most documents from this time period were drafted using little or no punctuation and sometimes-random capitalization. This document is no exception to that trend. This author has attempted to transcribe this text exactly as it appears in the original lawsuit. You will notice that the spelling of the name appears with and without the "S".<BR />Turk & wife<BR />v<BR />Raferty & wife<BR />"George the Third by the Grace of God of great Britain France & Ireland King Defender of the Faith To the Sherif of Augusta County Greeting we command you that you summon Thomas Raferty and Esther his wife<BR />To appear before the Justices of our said County Court at the Court House of the County on the third Tuesday in next month to Answer a Bill in Chancery (illegible) whereby Thomas Turk and Mary his wife, William Glave and Elizabeth Glave, and Michael Glave, Esther Glave and Matthew Glave. Infants by William Glave their guardian of this they shall in no wise omit under the penalty of 100 (pounds)"<BR />"To The Worshipful his Majesties. Justices of the County Court of Augusta (illegible) on Chancery Humbly Complaining their (illegible) of the Worships Your orator, Thomas Turk and Mary his wife, William Glaves, Elizabeth Glave, Michael Glave, Easter Glave, and Matthew Glave, infants by William Glave their guardian -- That sometime on or about the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty your orators' father Matthew Glaves departed this life intestate without making any disposition of his estate or effects and who at the time of his death was possessed of a very considerable personal estate. Orators having been informed consisting of Horses, Cattle, Hog's, Sheep, Household goods, and all kind of implements of Husbandry. That upon the Orator's father's death their mother Esther, since intermarried with Thomas Raferty the Defendants hereafter named possessed herself of the whole estate (your orators then being infants of very tender years) without ever taking out Letters of administration, soon after which before she disposed of the same intermarried with the other Defendant Thomas Raferty by virtue of which intermarriage he took the whole of your Orators estate into his custody and possession and used possessed and disposed of the same without ever rendering any account to either of your orators or to this worshipful Court. Your Orators Mary Turk and William Glaves since having come of age have often and in a friendly manner requested him so to do as such on his own account as on behalf of his infant brothers and sisters...."<BR />Although there is no record of a judgement, this single document provides a wealth of information about the Matthew Glaves family. It establishes Matthew's approximate date of death and names his wife Esther and his children. It tells us that Matthew died intestate, having no will. The document mentions "horses, cattle, pigs and household items", but no land. The family had probably settled on unclaimed land but had not had the necessary survey done in order to patent it and gain title. The actual lawsuit was dated August 20, 1771, although the case was not heard until the following March.''</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFFF"><td rowspan="2">Apprentice</td><td>24 Jan 1775</td><td>Augusta Co., VA</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFFF"><td colspan="2">``Matthew Gleaves vs John Finley, March 1794, Augusta County, Drawer 449<BR />This Indenture Wittnesseth that Mathew Gleaves son to Mathew Gleaves deceas'd of Augusta County and Colony of Virginia hath of his own Voluntary Consent and the Consent of his Guardian put and Bound himself apprentice unto John Finley wheelwright of the County and Colony afforesaid to learn his art trade or Mystery of a wheel-Wright and Cooper and after the Manner of an Apprentice to serve him from the Day and the Date hereof for and During ye full term of four years Next Ensuing During all which time he the said apprentice his said Master faithfully shall serve his secrets keep his lawfull commands every where Gladly obey he shall do no Damage to his said Master nor see it to be Done by others without giving notice thereof to his said Master he shall not waste his said Masters goods nor lend them unlawfully to others fornication he shall not committ Matrimony he shall not Contract at lands Dice or any other unlawfull game he shall not play whereby his said master may be damaged with his own goods or the goods of others he shall not buy nor sell without licence from his said master he shall not absent himself day nor night from his said Masters service without his leave nor haunt alehouses taverns or play houses but in all things behave himself as a faithfull apprentice ought to do During said term and the said master shall use the utmost of his Endeavours to teach or cause to be taught or instructed the said aprentice in the trade of Mystery he now professeth and procure or provide for him the said apprentice Sufficient meat Drink washing lodging and apparrel sufficient for an apprentice During said term and likewise at the Expiration of said term said Master is to provide for said aprentice a sett of tools fitt to carry on the business and for the true performance of every of the above articles we bind ourselves Each to the other by these presents in Wittness whereof we have interchangeably put our hands and seals this 24th Day of January 1775<BR />Test John Finley<BR />John Davidson Matthew Gleave<BR />Robt Finley William Gleave<BR />Edward Hunter<BR />c:\docs\virginia\gleaves2.txt<BR />aaa0216<BR />''</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><td rowspan="2">Tax</td><td>1779</td><td>Augusta Co., VA</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><td colspan="2">a Mathew Glaves was listed as delinquent on the 1779 tax of Augusta co., VA with the note "Rockingham" as in "gone/moved to Rockingham"</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFFF"><td rowspan="2">Buyer</td><td>30 May 1783</td><td>Augusta Co., VA</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFFF"><td colspan="2">A Mat.
