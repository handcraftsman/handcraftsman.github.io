The case involved a dispute over the estate of "Matthew Grove". Bob Allen obtained a copy of the original records in the Augusta County, Virginia Courthouse that Chalkley viewed in writing his abstract of this lawsuit. The actual record reveals that the family involved in the lawsuit is "Glave", not "Grove". Although the document is quite lengthy and overly verbose, the key points are listed below.<BR />Most documents from this time period were drafted using little or no punctuation and sometimes-random capitalization. This document is no exception to that trend. This author has attempted to transcribe this text exactly as it appears in the original lawsuit. You will notice that the spelling of the name appears with and without the "S".<BR />Turk & wife<BR />v<BR />Raferty & wife<BR />"George the Third by the Grace of God of great Britain France & Ireland King Defender of the Faith To the Sherif of Augusta County Greeting we command you that you summon Thomas Raferty and Esther his wife<BR />To appear before the Justices of our said County Court at the Court House of the County on the third Tuesday in next month to Answer a Bill in Chancery (illegible) whereby Thomas Turk and Mary his wife, William Glave and Elizabeth Glave, and Michael Glave, Esther Glave and Matthew Glave. Infants by William Glave their guardian of this they shall in no wise omit under the penalty of 100 (pounds)"<BR />"To The Worshipful his Majesties. Justices of the County Court of Augusta (illegible) on Chancery Humbly Complaining their (illegible) of the Worships Your orator, Thomas Turk and Mary his wife, William Glaves, Elizabeth Glave, Michael Glave, Easter Glave, and Matthew Glave, infants by William Glave their guardian -- That sometime on or about the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty your orators' father Matthew Glaves departed this life intestate without making any disposition of his estate or effects and who at the time of his death was possessed of a very considerable personal estate. Orators having been informed consisting of Horses, Cattle, Hog's, Sheep, Household goods, and all kind of implements of Husbandry. That upon the Orator's father's death their mother Esther, since intermarried with Thomas Raferty the Defendants hereafter named possessed herself of the whole estate (your orators then being infants of very tender years) without ever taking out Letters of administration, soon after which before she disposed of the same intermarried with the other Defendant Thomas Raferty by virtue of which intermarriage he took the whole of your Orators estate into his custody and possession and used possessed and disposed of the same without ever rendering any account to either of your orators or to this worshipful Court. Your Orators Mary Turk and William Glaves since having come of age have often and in a friendly manner requested him so to do as such on his own account as on behalf of his infant brothers and sisters...."<BR />Although there is no record of a judgement, this single document provides a wealth of information about the Matthew Glaves family. It establishes Matthew's approximate date of death and names his wife Esther and his children. It tells us that Matthew died intestate, having no will. The document mentions "horses, cattle, pigs and household items", but no land. The family had probably settled on unclaimed land but had not had the necessary survey done in order to patent it and gain title. The actual lawsuit was dated August 20, 1771, although the case was not heard until the following March.''</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><td rowspan="2">Property</td><td>19 Oct 1771</td><td>Augusta Co., VA</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><td colspan="2">``Name: Esther Rafferty<BR />Date: Oct 19, 1771<BR />Location: Augusta Co., VA<BR />Property: 18 acres on north side South River of Shanidore.<BR />Notes: This land record was originally published in "Chronicles of the Scotch-Irish Settlement in Virginia, 1745-1800.
