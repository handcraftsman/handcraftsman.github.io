It is 63 years since he left that farm, and this was his first visit back to the place where he spent the early days of his youth. He brought home with him as a prize possession, a number of plums picked from the old orchard. The visit recalled many memories especially of his parents who were prominent members of that community in the early days. They later moved to an eastern township and finally settled down in Tilbury East where they resided until their deaths, his father passing away 44 years ago and his mother going to her reward in 1877.<BR />Mr. Sinclair recalls that his grandmother, a very devout Scotch lady could repeat the 119th Psalm in Gaelic, and always offered her petitions in prayer at the family worship hour in that language. His grandfather always read in English but he too offered his prayers in Gaelic.<BR />Mr. Sinclair is at present staying with his son, Donald Sinclair, who is an employee of the Libby McNeill and Libby company, of long standing. During his visit to Sarnia he was treated with every courtesy, by the Mayor and other officials. He was particularly interested through (sic) a visit of inspection to the Sarnia hospital where he was shown every consideration. During his stay the Sarnia Canadian Observer published the following reference to his visit:<BR />-- [ begin insert ] --<BR />``An interesting visitor to Sarnia this week is John Sinclair, a guest at the Morrison hotel. Mr. Sinclair is seventy years "young" and is a former resident of Lambton county and at present resides with his son at 159 Gray Street, Chatham. During the week Mr. Sinclair spent a pleasant holiday visiting on the Bosanquet farm where he was born. He has been away from the old home for over 63 years and was very grateful (sic) for the reception tendered him by John Clemens Jr., Mrs. Clemens Sr., and Miss Doris Clemens, who now reside on the old homestead.<BR />Angus Sinclair, now deceased, was the eldest brother of the union and the remaining members of the family are Mrs. D. B. Armstrong of Fletcher, Ontario, wife of the postmaster; John, of Chatham, who owns 149 acres in Tilbury East, Kent county, well-known as the Sinclair farm, where he has resided for fifty-three years, and Daniel, now residing at Seattle, Washington. The family were all born in Bosanquet township on the farm now occupied by the Clemens family. The farm was purchased from Donald Sinclair by Abraham Clemens, grandfather of the present proprietor, John Clemens, whose widow, son John and daughter, Doris, reside on the farm.<BR />The father of John Sinclair was born on an ocean vessel which took 13 weeks to make the trip from the Old Country. His parents were born in Inverness, Scotland and arriving in Canada, settled near St. Thomas. Donald Sinclair at 21 years age, purchased lot 56, Bosanquet township, residing there for a time and later disposed of the property to Abraham Clemens. Mr. Sinclair spend the following three years at the gold rush in British Columbia. He later returned to Ontario and located in Victoria county. John Campbell, grandfather of the Sinclair family, and his wife, Catharine Ane (sic) Campbell, purchased lot 9, concession 3 Bosanquet township, consisting of 100 acres, in 1860, residing there until their death.<BR />John Sinclair has been a member of the Masonic order at Tilbury for 44 years. He is an 18th degree Mason and a member of the Scottish Rite. He expects to return to his home in Chatham on Friday''<BR />-- [ end insert ] --<BR />"</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><td rowspan="2">Obituary</td><td>14 Mar 1933</td><td>Chatham, Kent co., Ontario, Canada</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><td colspan="2">"John Sinclair Passes to Rest<BR />Was Well Known Retired Farmer of Tilbury East<BR />In the Public General hospital, at an early hour this morning, John Sinclair, well-known retired farmer of Tilbury East passed away following an illness of a year's duration.
