During his residence here, Mr. Brandenburg's quiet, unassuming way, his industrial, honest, reliable and wholesouled disposition made him many friends. As was said yesterday by many, ``no man could say anything against John Brandenburg,'' and what better legacy could a man leave? he was a good, industrious citizen, a devoted hisband and parent, and in his death the family have the sympathy of all.<BR />In 1866 Mr. Brandenburg was united in marriage with Mary Wilke, who survives him.
