P.; TWIN VALLEY, ITS SETTLEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT HISTORY 1798-1882, Christian Publishing Co., Dayton, Ohio, 1883 pp 109-125<BR />``Her maiden name was Lorisch, and the place of her birth in Berks County, Pennsylvania. Her father's given name is not known. Her parents were farmers. Somewhere between the years 1750 and 1760, when Catharine was yet a child, it happened one day, whilst the whole family were in the harvest field at work, that they were surprised by hostile Indians. It was the time of the French-English war, carried on for the possession of the "North-west;" the Indians were allied to the French, and under their instigation were committing depredations in the settlements which were under English protection. they were unusually ferocious at this time, devastating and depopulating large districts of country. The German people of Pennsylvania especially suffered from their incursions. Many a peaceful home among them was laid in ashes, whilst their inmates were either cruelly massacred, or else carried away into captivity. There were, at the time spoken of, four of the Lorisch family, both parents, Catharine and an infant girl. The latter was seated on the ground, and the first that the mother saw, to know that there were Indians near, was a large Indian rushing toward her child and snatching it up, either to kill it or else to carry it off. This so excited her, that, ere she had time to reflect of the consequences of her act, she struck the Indian over the head with a rake. At this the brutal savage became so enraged that he instantly sunk his tomahawk int the woman's head. The rest of the family were made captives, and were at once started westward. There were other Indians and other captives whom they joined on their way. Their march continued for many days, and took them over rivers and across mountains and through dense forests, and was extremely fatiguing, especially to the women and children. They had very little to eat, and thus to fatigue and sorrow were added the pangs of hunger. Catharine's infant sister, being the greatest sufferer of all, as there was nothing at all she could eat or drink, cried incessantly. Her cries becoming annoying to the Indians, they tore the child from its sister's arms, and threw it into a stream to drown it. Catharine became frantic with grief, and begged piteously for the life of the child. Her entreaties moved an old squaw to pity, and she interceded for her, and succeeded in having the child restored to her. Soon after this a deer just killed was brought into camp. It had had young, and being still warm, Catharine milked it, and with the milk fed her famishing infant sister, and thus saved her life. The Indians went a great distance; how far they went Catharine did not know then, and afterward could not tell. They may have gone as for as Western Pennsylvania, or even into Ohio. There are those who say the Mrs. Schaeffer, when late in life she came the Twin Valley, recognized this as one the localities through which she had passed during her captivity. But the writer is somewhat skeptical as to the truth of this fact. Catharine retained charge of her sister in the camp as she had done on the march, and performed to her the part of a nurse and a mother. After some time the father and his youngest child were given their freedom, and returned to their home, but with Catharine the Indians were unwilling to part. For seven long years she remained in captivity. Her infant sister's name was Elizabeth, who, later, married John Emerick, moved from Berks to Dauphin County, and from there to the Twin Valley, about the year 1810, was the mother of George Emerick, with whom she spent the last years of her life, and died at the age of about ninety years.<BR />Catharine Lorisch was a rather handsome maiden. of the shape and complexion of countenance and general make-up of form, which were admired by the Indians. Her features were regular, her complexion was fair and ruddy, her eyes dark and brilliant, and her hair was auburn. It was on account of these external attractions that the Indians were anxious to retain her, and watched and guarded her with jealous eye. She was well enough treated, but the years of her captivity were to her, nevertheless, years of sadness and sorrow. Yet she bore all her afflictions with quietness and patience. Her parents were members of the Lutheran Church, and had taught her to pray. In her captivity she remembered their instructions, and was comfoï¿½ted. She never ceased to pray to her Saviour for a pious heart, and for her restoration to her kindred and home. She was assigned as servant to an old Indian chief, who was no longer able to engage in the chase, or to accompany his tribe on their various excursions. She prepared and set before him his food, and ministered to his comforts as a child would to a parent. She soon learned to speak the Indian language with fluency, which she never after forgot. The Indians pierced her nose and ears, and put on her such ornaments as they themselves are accustomed to wear. They aimed to make her forget her home and friends, and to attach her permanently to themselves. But in this they were not quite successful. For though she tried to make the best of her lot, her thoughts and affections were always with her relations.<BR />The Indians at last trusted her as much as they did one of their own number. She was often left quite alone with the aged chief, and suffered to go unattended into the wilds, to gather herbs and roots and firewood. Frequently, prompted by curiosity, she would wander off great distances. It thus happened that one day, having gone from home a greater distance than usual, she come to a river bank, where she saw white men engaged in building a large boat. She approached them, and they allowed her to pick up chips which she carried with her for firewood. At first the men building the boat took her to be an Indian, but after she was gone they talked about her between them, and come to the conclusion that she was a white person. She came again the next day, and on inquiry they found their suspicion confirmed. As after this she did not make her appearance again, they determined to steal her. With this end in view they waited a favorable opportunity. This soon came. By some means they learned that the men had all gone away. They went to their village, found Catharine, and told her that they had come to take her away. She was but too glad and ready to accompany them, and at once went to work to prepare for her departure. When the old chief learned what was going on, he called Catharine to him, and bade her affectionately good-by, made her many presents of trinkets such as Indians prepare with their own hands, and wept like a child, an exhibition of affection and grief quite unusual for an Indian. The trinkets Mrs. Schaeffer kept to the end of her life, and always valued them very highly.<BR />locality where this took place is not accurately known at present. By some it is supposed to have been in the vicinity of Wheeling, Virginia, on the Ohio side. But this is mere conjecture. It is more likely that it was in Northeastern Ohio, along the shores of Lake Erie, inasmuch as at the time various Indian tribes had here permanently established themselves, and lived more securely than they did in the southern of south-eastern part of what now constitutes the State of Ohio. The boat or ship, being built, may have been designed for lake navigation. The builders of it were, at least, no ordinary persons, as the sequel plainly indicates.<BR />After Catharine had been liberated, the question arose where to take her. As she knew not what had became of the family, or where, if they were still living, they now were, to take her to her former home was out of the question. In this dilemma the gentleman, who had charge of the workmen, decided to take her under his care, provide for her wants, and treat her as if she were his own child. As these events happened about the year 1760, or somewhat later, when the French had been excluded from the county, and the colonies were subject to England, the inference to be drawn is, that the boat built was a naval vessel, designed for service on Lake Erie, and that Catharine's protector was a naval officer, employed in the service of his Majesty the King of England. It is a cause of regret that here data are lacking, to speak with more confidence. But whoever this man may have been, this much is definitely known, that he took Catharine with him to some large eastern city, placed her in his own family, dressed her in a style becoming his own station in society, and afforded her the best educational facilities available. She ought now to have been happy, but she was not. She seems to have been a person of very warm family attachment, and nothing could render her truly happy and contented except a restoration to her kindred and childhood's home.<BR />By this time Catharine had grown to be a young lady, and had arrived at an age when young people begin to think and meditate upon their personal affairs and interests. She now more often than ever thought of home and friends, and, as she did so, the desire ever grew stronger within her once more to see and greet her father. When she had acquired the art of writing, and from her study of geography, had learned the locality of her childhoods home, she addressed a letter to her father. To this letter, to her inexpressibly joy, she received an answer, which informed her that her father was living and well. As may be readily inferred, he had but one desire concerning her - he wanted to see her once more, and that right speedily. Accordingly, in this same letter, he invited her to return at once. That lost child had been in his thoughts and affections these many years. As Jacob of old had bitterly wept over the loss of his son Joseph, so this father had mourned over his captive daughter. Perhaps he had long given her up for lost and dead. The greater was his joy now on hearing that she was alive and safe.<BR />But Catharine's benefactor, by this time, had become so much attached to her, that he felt reluctant to give her up. There was everything about her to endear her to any one, but to this man she was doubly precious from the manner in which she had come under his protection. He therefore used every proper means to induce her to remain. He promised her a life of quiet and abundance, and assured her of the treatment of a child, if she would abide with him and his family. But it was all to no purpose. She continued to beseech him for permission to visit her father, and he at last consented, with the understanding, however, that she was to return. She went. There was gladness when father and child met once more, and fondly and gratefully grazed upon one another. As they recited to each other their peril and sufferings, their trials and sorrows, they wept and laughed by turns.<BR />now came another trying ordeal for Catharine. She had come on a visit only, and was expected to return, after a proper length of time, to the man who had rescued and befriended her. To this her father could not think of giving his consent. The mere thought of separating again from his child gave him pain. To let her go away seemed almost like sending her back the savage men of the wilderness. The more and the longer he thought of it, the less able was he to make up his mind to do it. What was she to do? She felt herself under obligation to her kind benefactor. He had redeemed her from a captivity almost worse then death, and had kindly taken her to his home, and had treated her with the lavish indulgence of a fond parent. Was she to reward him for all this by deserting him against his will? Besides this, had he not held out to her the prospect of wealth and social position? What could her father give her in compensation for such sacrifices He was but a plain farmer, and had no flattering prospects to offer her. All he could promise her was, a father's affection, menial service and hard toil. Between these conflicting interests and obligations Catharine's struggle was a most severe one. But finally, natural affection triumphed over everything else. She decided to remain with her father, and sacrifice wealth and station to the love which she cherished for him.<BR />Some years after this she gave her hand in marriage to Peter Schaeffer, a young man of the neighborhood in which she resided. With him she lived happily until his death. As already stated, they had eight children. After her husband's decease Mrs. Schaeffer made her home in the family of her son-in-law, Mr. George Boyer. When the Boyers moved from Berks to Center County, she accompanied them, and when from there again they emigrated to Ohio she went with them to the same State. She came to the Twin Valley in 1805.<BR />Mrs. Schaeffer was a communicant member of the Lutheran Church, and a devoutly pious lady. The Bible was her constant companion. She never, if able to be present, absented herself from the sanctuary on the Lord's Day. During the dozen years that she lived in the Twin Valley, she proved herself a blessing to all with whom she came in social contact. During her captivity among the Indians she had acquired from them some knowledge of the medicinal properties and uses of roots and herbs. As physicians in her day were not very numerous, she was often applied to for advice and assistance in cases of sickness. It thus happened that by degrees she got into quite an extensive medical practice. She was especially skilful in midwifery, and those who knew her best had the utmost confidence in her as reliable physician.<BR />She thoroughly understood the Indian character, and always retained a dread of the Red Man. She declared the Indians to be a treacherous, vindictive, and cruel race, with very few redeeming qualities about them. Whilst living among them, she saw them commit acts of the most savage and shocking barbarity. They often brought white captives into the camp, who had incurred their special displeasure. These they would slowly torture to death amidst the intensest sufferings. They would first strip their victims to the skin, then they would make incisions into the flesh all over their bodies, and into these they would inset sharp-pointed and ragged-edged sticks, until they would bristle all over with them, They would then set fire to these sticks, and slowly roast their victime, until, after hours of the most excruciating agony, death would come to their relief. Whilst this was being done by the executioners the rest of the savages seemed to be in great glee, dancing, shouting, and whooping, and feasting themselves upon the horrible agony of their helpless victim. The children of white people who had given offence to them, they would hold suspended by the arms over a fire until life would become extinct in them. Mrs. Schaeffer, whilst witnessing such scenes, would almost die of terror. Such were the impressions thereby<BR />on her mind, that the remembrance of them would make her tremble with excitement to the end of her days.<BR />During the first few years of her residence in Ohio the Indians were still numerous in this State. They soon learned who she was, and after that she was frequently favored with their visits. They would hang around her for days, encamp in the woods near her residence, and visit her day after day, always asking for this or that favor. She conversed with them in their own tongue, and treated them kindly, not because she cherished any feeling of kindness for them, but more because she feared them. She would allow no one to offend them, knowing how very vindictive and revengeful they were. She would always rather hide from them than meet them. And there really was reason for her fears. They considered her one of their own race. and had they had a chance, they would have abducted her, and carried her to their distant haunts.<BR />The number of the descendents of this lady can not, by this time, fall far short of one thousand. Five hundred, at least, of the people of Germantown are directly descended of her. Her own family was large, and her children have reared large families, and every generation has intermarried into other families, until at present a large portion of the population of Germantown is related to her. The only regret is that some of her descendents, whilst they carry in their veins her blood, in their hearts do not carry her Christian character and virtues.<BR />Mrs. Catharine Schaeffer died August 16, 1818, in the seventy-third year of her life. Her remains lie buried in the Lutheran graveyard in Germantown. A marble slab marks their resting-place.
